<h2>My 3 favourite books as of 2024</h2>
<hr/>

<p><h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3><br/>
This is the best fantasy book ever written. It simply has not been matched.</p>

<p><h3>Das Kapital</h3> <br/>
Whilst there has been many strides in critique of the political economy since then, the leaps forward made by Marx in Das Kapital revolutionised the ability of the world to analyse the capitalist mode of production.</p>

<p><h3>The Way of Kings</h3>
Whilst I'm not entirely sold on the direction of the series as a whole, as a first book in a fantasy series, the way of Kings really hits it out of the park.</p>
